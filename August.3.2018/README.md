# The Eternal Question: How Much Do These Apricots Weigh?

>**Riddler Express:** A small fruity puzzle: you loaded a drying shed containing 1,000 kilograms of apricots. They were 99 percent water. After a day in the shed, they are now 98 percent water. How much do the apricots weigh now?

**Solution:** The apricots weigh 500kg.

Originally the apricots weighed 1000kg and 99% was water weight. This means that 1% (or 10kg) of the apricots was another substance. After a day in the shed the apricots are only 98% water. Without thinking, a natural inclination might be to assume that 1% of water was lost so the apricots weigh 10kg (1%) less than the day before. However, this is incorrect. 

The apricots are now 98% water, which means that the other substance now comprises 2% of the apricots. The proportion of that substance doubled overnight from 1% to 2% yet the weight of the substance (10kg) was not altered. If 2% of the apricots weighs 10kg, then simple arithmetic (10kg * (100/2)) tells us that the apricots now weigh 500kg.
