# FiveThirtyEight The Riddler Solutions

The Riddler is a weekly puzzle column on FiveThirtyEight run by the riddler himself, Oliver Roeder. Each week he posts a new pair of interesting and sometimes mind-numbing mathematical puzzles for the public to solve. 

These are some of my solutions to his column. Each week's riddle is stored in a folder (with that weeks date) and includes a README explanation for my solution as well as any code I might have used.

Feel free to read through these as I post and let me know what I can improve.

To give yourself a _healthy_ bit of fun each week head to [538 The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) to check out the puzzles for yourself.
